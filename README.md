A Matlab demo script ([recursive_autoconv_demo.m] (recursive_autoconv_demo.m)) submitted as supplementary material for paper "Autoconvolution for Unsupervised Feature Learning" to NIPS 2016

Tested on Matlab 2015b, no specific toolboxes or dependencies are required


We also provide a Lua script ([recursive_autoconv_demo.lua] (recursive_autoconv_demo.lua)) for Torch fans

Additional code for the paper is provided at https://github.com/bknyaz/autocnn_unsup.
